            <h2>Empowerment</h2>
            <p>Our coalition is rooted in feminist empowerment. We believe in equity, equality, and empowerment.</p>
            <p>Everyone should have the right to choose not just how to live their life, but also choose what the future of their community looks like. But part of being empowered to make change in our communities comes from being able to participate in the conversations about what affects us and how.

            <h2>Transparency</h2>
            <p>We believe in trust and transparency, between individual residents and between residents and their local government.</p>
            <p>A lot of information about air pollution in Louisville is available to local residents, but making information available is not the same as making that information accessible. Scientific and legal information is only transparent if it is written to the local communities affected by that information.

        <div class="principles-section principles-section-3">
            <h2>Access</h2>
            <p>We believe that everyone should have access to a happy, healthy life in Louisville.
            </p>
            <p>Everyone deserves to live a life free from toxic air.  Regardless of what businesses insist on operating in our neighborhoods, we deserve clean air. And because our air has been polluted for far too long, we deserve equitable access to affordable healthcare that cares for families.</p>
